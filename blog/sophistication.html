            <h1>Increased Sophistication in the Human World</h1>
            <p>
                This blogpost/essay is an amalgamation of my inner ramblings over the last few days. It is merely meant
                to depict the increasing sophistication of the human world and also point out the intrinsically weird
                aspects in all of them. This is not meant to be a rigorous scientific review (THIS IS NOT A JOURNAL) so
                don't expect scientific/literary accuracy and citations for my statements. Each sophistication is
                vaguely chronologically ordered on the basis of its root.
            </p>
            <h2>Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                Consider the following statements:
            <ol>
                <li>Fruits are just the ripened ovary of fertilized flowers. Plants provide nutririous, watery masses
                    for animal consumption, hoping that the seeds enclosed inside will disperse and germinate far away.
                </li>
                <li>Seeds are laden with nutrients for the embryo.</li>
                <li>Vegetables are merely the consumable parts of plants</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
                By practising agriculture, we have hijacked the natural processes involved in reproduction and seed
                dispersal of plants.
            </blockquote>
            The products are either consumed directly, or used to feed animals whose bodies and/or
            products are consumed. Agriculture seemingly increased the productivity of land, which allowed a section of
            the populace to practise other trades and also promote agglomerations of humans that eventually paved the
            way to civilization.
            <br> <br>
            Sophistication in agriculture has not stopped. The required labour has been provided by humans and animals,
            whereas the required energy has been derived from water (watermills), wind (windmills) or electricity
            (mechanization). Water was sometimes forcefully routed in order to provide irrigation. In the 20th century,
            with advances in medicine and sanitation, it was hypothesized that the
            geometric increase in human population will eclipse the linear increase in food production, thereby leading
            to global famines. One persistent issue was exhaustion of nitrogen (in the form of nitrates and ammonia) in
            soil upon repeated cultivation. Nitrogen is central to the "amino" in amino acids, which are the building
            blocks of proteins. Ironically, nitrogen is the most abundant component of air. Plants (and humans too, for
            a long time) could not directly draw nitrogen from air because the triple bond in nitrogen is difficult to
            break. However, Fritz Haber managed to make the following reaction go favourably in the forward direction:
            \[ N_2 + 3 H_2 \leftrightarrow 2 NH_3 \rightarrow NO_3^{-2} \]
            Since the above reaction is entropically unfavourable because four moles of eqs are converted into two moles
            of eqs, it can be driven by high temperature and high pressure. The scaling of this reaction from a
            laboratory setting to a industrial scale production is the difference between chemistry and chemical
            engineering.
            <br> <br>
            In the 1960s, there was sophistication at a much lower level, wherein selective breeding and hybridization
            led to crops with increased yield and increased resilience to external risk factors. Essentially, humans
            bootstrapped evolution by applying their own selection pressures. We have probably reached a stage
            wherein food production is (or can be made) adequate, and starvation/malnutrition is due to food
            distribution issues. Lab-grown meat is another front for sophistication.
            </p>
            <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>
                Language is an oral and/or symbolic represetation of objects, ideas, events, and the relationships
                between them.
            <blockquote>
                Somehow, groups of humans agreed that a sequence of sounds, or a series of symbols have a
                specific meaning.
            </blockquote>
            Language is essential for transmission of information, which ensures that continuing
            generations don't begin in this world from scratch. We also have constructed languages with specific
            syntax that we use to instruct computers.
            </p>
            <h2>Currency</h2>
            <p>
                The barter system is not convenient or scalable. If person A has object w and wants object x, whereas
                person B has object y and wants object z, then currency is a handy intermediary for each pairwise
                transaction to take place.
            <blockquote>
                Currency is virtually any entity (object, paper, digital information) whose value exists as long as
                people collectively believe that it has value.
            </blockquote>
            People have discarded their currency (in favour of other) when they believed that it has no value, either
            due to lack of
            legitimacy of the state's financial authority, or due to runaway inflation. In the 14th century lived a
            certain Malian king named Mansa Musa, who is believed to be one of the richest people in history. When he
            decided to go on pilgrimage to Mecca ("Hajj"), he gave away so much gold during his journey that it
            deprecated the value of gold. Since the currency in the economy increased, people could afford more
            commodities. But since the supply was unchanged, the cost of commodities increased. People observed that the
            purchasing power of gold decreased, and collectively adjusted their hypothesis of its value. Hence the
            collective imagination not only controls the legitimacy of currency, but also its value.
            <br> <br>
            Currency has made the transition from objects to coins to paper, and finally to digital information. A lot
            of effort and sophistication goes into making sure that currency is difficuly to counterfeit. National
            entities try to keep track of how much currency is flowing, how much of it is saved, and how much of it is
            stored in various financial assets. They control how much of currency is printed, and they limit the rate at
            which additional currency is created/charged on stored/loaned currnecy ("interest") in order to control
            inflation. Cryptocurrencies are an attempt to make decentralised currencies, because nation states have
            indeed been reckless with currencies/economies in the past, and they use much more convoluted mechanisms to
            make and verify transactions.
            </p>
            <h2>Ideology</h2>
            <p>
                If all of humanity's knowledge is lost, then math and physics can be potentially rediscovered, but there
                are certain beliefs that can never be rediscovered, merely because they never had physical existence in
                the first place. Religions, nationalism, currency, politics, culture, linguistics, etc. can all
                be regarded as ideologies. They serve as powerful forces in uniting people, for better or for the worse.
            </p>
            <h2>Weaponry</h2>
            <p>There is a stark asymmetry in sophistication between the two classes of weapons:
            <blockquote>
                While melee weapons have always been sharp objects and tough sticks, humans have always innovated at
                ways to throw stuff at each other from a distance
            </blockquote>
            <ol>
                <li>Throwing stones</li>
                <li>Using elastic energy to throw stones further (catapults)</li>
                <li>Same as (2) but using projectiles with better piercing power (bow and arrow)</li>
                <li>Using the potential energy of uncomfortably placed atoms to drive expansion and push an object with
                    a fast speed (cannons/mortars)</li>
                <li>Same as (4), but using projectiles with better piercing power (guns/rifles)</li>
                <li>Making the projectile self-propelled (missiles)</li>
                <li>Same as (6), but the explosion is instead due to rapidly cascading nuclear reactions (nukes)</li>
                <li>Expelling flammable gas that is set on fire (flamethrower)</li>
                <li>Shooting bolts of electricity (tasers)</li>
                <li>[FUTURE] Using electromagnetic force to launch projectiles (railgun)</li>
                <li>[FUTURE] Literally throwing a concentrated beam of photons (lasers)</li>
            </ol>
            (as a side note, in the current epoch of our universe, there are four fundamental forces: elasticity and
            explosions are forms of electromagnetic force whereas nukes get their energy from strong nuclear force. One
            can (theoretically) use gravity in gravitational slingshots, but it remains to be seen whether the weak
            nuclear force can be weaponised :-)
            <br> <br>
            Even more interesting is the fact that these sophistications in projectile-throwing devices have been
            incorporated in all sorts of mobile entities: archers on horses, rifles on automobiles,
            cannons on ships, artillery on locomotives ("Schwerer Gustav"), missiles on aircrafts, and nukes on
            submarines. The future of warfare will probably involve these projectiles-throwing devices on drones and
            unmanned vehicles. The only remaining mobile entities are space stations and satellites. This is the only
            facet which separates our reality from Star Wars.
            </p>
            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>
                The first steam locomotive rolled out sometime in the beginning of the 19th century. Let me paint a
                picture of how absurd the whole arrangement was:
            <blockquote>
                The force of expanding steam from boiling water was used to push pistons, which rotated a set of wheels
                resting on tracks of steel (specially laid out for that purpose) with enough traction to pull several
                heavy carriages
            </blockquote>
            Transportation started from animal-drawn carriages and boats, but it evolved to trains, automobiles, ships,
            airplanes and space shuttles. Trains went from being drawn by steam locomotives to diesel and electric
            locomotives. Most cars today use ignited fuel to push pistons, and drive on specially constructed roads. The
            fuel as well as the road material comes from fractional distillation of liquid fossilized remains of
            long-dead organisms. Rowed boats mutated into ships driven by winds and later, engines.
            <br> <br>
            Hot-air balloons and gliders were thought to be the only forms of air travel, since it was believed that
            heavier-than-air vehicles cannot float in air. This was proved wrong by a couple of bicycle engineers. Just
            66 years later, USA employed a former Nazi to construct a rocket that ejected burnt liquid oxygen and
            hydrogen at an impulse of 4 km/s and pushed two astronauts to the moon in order to win the space
            race set in the backdrop of a clash of ideologies. Now, we have satellites and space stations whirling
            around the Earth, and a bunch of space probes exploring other celestial bodies.
