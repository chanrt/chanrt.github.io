        <p>
            As far as AI is concerned, I'm mostly interested in their creative applications. For example: game-playing
            AI, metahuristic optimizaton, using pre-trained models for innovative purposes, etc. I haven't explored much
            of main-stream AI/ML.

                    I used minimax algorithm to implement chess AI in Python, using PyGame for graphics. Minimax
                    algorithm requires an evaluation function, which takes in the state of the board and outputs a score
                    that conveys which player is winning and by what extent. I implemented a simple evaluation function
                    which considers just positional and material advantages. Minimax algorithm assumes that each player
                    will try to maximize their own evaluation, and outputs the best possible move by looking ahead a
                    certain number of steps. I incorporated multiprocessing after the first move to speed up the
                    process. Currently, only 3-4 moves can be looked ahead, although this number can be increased via
                    optimizations like alpha-beta pruning. You can find the repository <a

                        What if we can use the principles of evolution to solve optimization problems? Genetic algorithm
                        is a metaheuristic optimization method which uses mutation and recombination in order to
                        maximize fitness of a population of genes towards a given problem. I considered a very abstract
                        problem: guiding a bunch of blind entities from point A to point B, whilst avoiding collision
                        with walls and obstacles. You can access the simulation <a

                        I implemented an entire pipeline which takes in an image and infers all the text present in it.
                        This process is composed of several steps:
                    <ol>
                        <b>Image preprocessing:</b> A color image or a grayscale image needs to be converted into a
                        binary image. This is acheived via adaptive thresholding. Any skew/rotation in the image is
                        fixed maximizing the intra-class variance of the row histogram.
                        <br>
                        <b>Image segmentation:</b> All paragraphs in the image need to be broken down into lines, all
                        lines into words, and all words into letters. This is again achieved by histogramming. This
                        model cannot deal with cursive letters yet. The main aim was to read printed-text, which was
                        easily achieved with high accuracy.
                        <br>
                        <b>Character preprocessing:</b> This just involves resizing the character into a square frame
                        with adequate margin space, followed by skeletonization if necessary.
                        <br>
                        <b>Character recognition:</b> I trained 4 models: a DNN model and a CNN model on hand-written
                        text and printed-text. The character is fed into the trained neural network, and all the
                        probabilities are recorded. The character with the highest probability is initially chosen.
                        <br>
                        <b>Post-processing:</b> This involves doing spell-correction, replacing numbers with letter when
                        numbers don't make sense, etc. Integration an NLP model here would be useful. Post-processing
                        also involves computing a metric called Levenstein distance, which is later used to calculate
                        the accuracy of the entire pipeline.
                    </ol>
                    As is expected, the CNN model trained on printed characters had highest accuracy. You can find the
                    repository <a href="https://github.com/chanrt/image-segmentation-ocr" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        I initially made a simplified, procedural, obstacle avoidance game called Infinity Run. I used a
                        method called ray-casting in order to figure out how close the walls are on all angles, and
                        accordingly render the height of the walls. At this point, I realised that I could integrate a
                        pre-trained model for hand-detection, and thereby allow the player to control the character (go
                        left/go right) by giving input into the webcam! For this purpose, I used a model from mediapipe
                        (Google). The framerate is a bit low because the inference takes time, and my laptop isn't
                        top-notch. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/chanrt/infinity-run"
